# Lab report 3

I chose grep to research because it's the command that I've noticed has the most real-world use.

## Option 0

For option 0, I chose to use the -r option (or -d recurse) which lets grep recursively search all the files in a directory tree for a matching pattern. I found this option on the manpage.

### Example 1

Find lucayans

### Example 2

## Option 1

For option 1, I chose to use the -f option which lets grep match based on patterns that are contained in a file. I found this option on the manpage.

### Example 1

Just a generic match

### Example 2

Idk, something else generic

## Option 2

For option 2, I chose to use the -o option which makes grep print only the parts of the file (or input) that match the pattern. What's notable is this can be used with wc to count the number of times a pattern occurs in a given input or file. I found this option on the manpage.

### Example 1

Count occurences of Lucayans (or some other word)

### Example 2

Count occurences of word in written_2

## Option 3

For option 1, I chose to use the -E option which has grep do matches using extended regular expressions. THis allows more flexibility with pattern matching. I found this option on the manpage.

### Example 1

### Example 2

Count number of sentences in a file



The end.
