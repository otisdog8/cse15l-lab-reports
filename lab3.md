# Lab report 3

I chose grep to research because it's the command that I've noticed has the most real-world use.

## Option 1

For option 1, I chose to use the -f option which lets grep match based on patterns that are contained in a file. I found this option on the manpage.

### Example 1

### Example 2

## Option 2

For option 2, I chose to use the -o option which makes grep print only the parts of the file (or input) that match the pattern. What's notable is this can be used with wc to count the number of times a pattern occurs in a given input or file. I found this option on the manpage.
